## Problem Domain
- I live in and manage a public living space where people are free to come and go. People will often leave trash lying around, forcing residents to clean up after them.

---

## Proposed Solution
- Set up a monitoring system that keeps track of who comes and goes through the living space and keep track of what they are bringing and leaving in the living space.

## Architecture
- ESP32 micro controller
- Raspberry Pie for handling AI-driven software
- Input/Monitoring Device

## Schedule and Milestones

### Sprint 1
- Gather resources and compomnents required for project
- Set up an environment/workspace and start working on the software

### Sprint 2
